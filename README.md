# M-OEIS
Mathematica programs for OEIS sequences.

This is a collection of Mathematica programs that I have implemented for some of the integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org). It is necessary to mention that not all Mathematica programs in this repository belong to sequences of my authorship, in fact at the moment I have only two sequences of my authorship registered in the OEIS database, and these sequences are:

->[A348960](https://oeis.org/A348960): a(n) = floor(log_10(Pi*n!)).

->[A363743](https://oeis.org/A363743): a(n) = floor(sqrt(log_10(n!))).

My main goal with this repository is to keep track of all the Mathematica programs that I have contributed to OEIS entries. In addition, I would like to have the contribution of other researchers or users of the encyclopedia who have written programs in Mathematica for OEIS entries and who wish to grow the database of Mathematica programs in this repository, in order to make this repository the largest collection of Mathematica programs implemented for OEIS entries registered on Github.

## Workflow.

This is the workflow I manage for this repository:

**1)** First, write the raw code for the Mathematica program and save it in a file named after the corresponding OEIS code entry, for example, **A363743**. The file should be saved in the designated folder: **Mathematica programs for OEIS entries**. This program must reproduce the exact amount of data published in the OEIS entry. Additionally, I like to include the link to the OEIS sequence.
