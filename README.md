# M-OEIS
Mathematica programs for OEIS sequences.

This is a collection of Mathematica programs that I have implemented for some of the integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org). It is necessary to mention that not all Mathematica programs in this repository belong to sequences of my authorship, in fact at the moment I have only two sequences of my authorship registered in the OEIS database, and these sequences are:

->[A348960](https://oeis.org/A348960): a(n) = floor(log_10(Pi*n!)).

->[A363743](https://oeis.org/A363743): a(n) = floor(sqrt(log_10(n!))).

My main goal with this repository is to keep track of all the Mathematica programs that I have contributed to OEIS entries. In addition, I would like to have the contribution of other researchers or users of the encyclopedia who have written programs in Mathematica for OEIS entries and who wish to grow the database of Mathematica programs in this repository, in order to make this repository the largest collection of Mathematica programs implemented for OEIS entries registered on Github.

## Workflow.

This is the workflow I manage for this repository:

**1)** First, write the raw code for the Mathematica program and save it in a file named after the corresponding OEIS code entry, for example, **A363743**. The file should be saved in the designated folder: **Mathematica programs for OEIS entries**. This program must reproduce the exact amount of data published in the OEIS entry. Additionally, I like to include the link to the OEIS sequence.

**2)** Upload a Mathematica notebook file to the **"Mathematica notebooks for OEIS entries"** folder. The file should contain the following items:

* The Mathematica program.
* The exact amount of data published on the OEIS entry.
* Not more than two formulas (If any formula exists) reported on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, used to reproduce the mathematical sequence.
* References to the sequences involved in the OEIS entry.

## My Mathematica Specs.

Currently I have access to two PCs that have:

* Mathematica v12.1.1.0 (which I use the most)
* Mathematica v13.3.1.

and where I develop the Mathematica programs that I upload to the OEIS database.

Finally, I run some tests for the Mathematica programs in the Wolfram cloud service, mainly to look for any optimization on the programs and to test the execution time that the programs need due to the excellent computational power that the Wolfram cloud brings.
